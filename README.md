# MangoFixer
A plugin which checks if the item sent by the player exists in the inventory. If not, the item shall be considered as an invalid item and is in an attempt to crash the server by sending the item with nbt that never existed on the server. Create a packet dump of the packet containing the invalid item, kick the player and notify online admins about it. For debugging, include an id for the packet dump in the disconnect message and save the dump with the id as its file name. For more robust debugging, the plugin can also save the current bukkit inventory of the player with the plugin based via translated inventory. Use packet events api for this. Additionally, use pre-via packet hook to also prevent viaversion based exploits. If any of the netty threads of the server starts lagging, then a stack trace shall be dumped.
